# Demo Prompts
These are prompts used during my demo for the "Build the future with MCP" Hackathon hosted by 
Smithery, WorkOS, Anthropic, Stainless, Beeper, MongoDB.

### Prompt 1
I have attached an image of a person. Detect their pose, and give me exact coordinates for their left knee, right knee, and one of their elbows.

### Prompt 2
In the attached image, detect objects in the scene. If there is at least one fruit, remove the background in the image then show the resulting image using the command line (use the `open` command).
